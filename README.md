# Space Invaders - Python Game Development
A classic arcade-style **Space Invaders** game built using Python and the Pygame library. This project demonstrates core game development principles, including game loops, event handling, coordinate systems, and collision detection.

## Overview

This project was developed to explore the fundamentals of game engineering and real-time application state management. It features a player-controlled spaceship that must defend against waves of descending alien enemies. The game tracks the player's score and features a dynamic "Game Over" state when enemies breach the player's defenses.

### Key Features
* **Real-time Movement:** Fluid player control and automated enemy movement patterns.
* **Collision Physics:** Precise detection for projectile impacts using mathematical distance formulas.
* **Dynamic Scoring:** A real-time UI that tracks and displays player performance.
* **Multimedia Integration:** Custom sprite rendering, background music, and sound effects for immersive gameplay.

## Technical Stack
* **Language:** Python 3.x
* **Library:** Pygame
* **Concepts:** Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), Game Loops, Event Handling, Vector Math.

## Installation & Setup

1.  **Prerequisites:** Ensure you have Python installed.
2.  **Install Pygame:**
    ```bash
    pip install pygame
    ```
3.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/Arghya-Tech99/Space-Invaders-game.git](https://github.com/Arghya-Tech99/Space-Invaders-game.git)
    cd space-invaders
    ```
4.  **Run the Game:**
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

## How to Play
* **Left/Right Arrows:** Move the spaceship.
* **Spacebar:** Fire lasers.
* **Objective:** Destroy all enemies before they reach the bottom of the screen.

## Future Roadmap & Enhancements
To further evolve this project and showcase advanced software engineering skills, the following features are planned for future releases:

* **Interactive Player Menu:** Implementation of a robust main menu screen featuring "Start Game," "Settings," and "Quit" options.
* **Adaptive Difficulty System:**
    * **Tiered Enemies:** Introducing diverse enemy types with unique sprites and increased health points at higher score ranges.
    * **Dynamic Scaling:** Automatically increasing enemy descent speed and firing frequency as the player progresses.
* **Persistent High Scores:** Integrating a local database or JSON-based storage to track and display top player performances across sessions.
